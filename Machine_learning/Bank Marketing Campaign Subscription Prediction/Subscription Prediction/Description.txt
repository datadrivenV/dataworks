Bank Marketing Campaign - Project Description

Objective:
To predict customer subscription to a term deposit based on a marketing campaign dataset, using
exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and a neural network classifier. The project includes
an in-depth EDA, a custom neural network model in Python, and robust model evaluation
techniques.
Project Workflow:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Purpose: The EDA aims to uncover patterns and insights within the data, such as distributions
and relationships between features and the target variable (`y`). Key visualizations include:
- Age distribution (histogram) to understand the customer age demographics.
- Job type distribution (bar plot) to identify customer segments and analyze job influence on
subscriptions.
- Balance distribution by subscription status (`y`), analyzed through box plots, to understand
financial balance impact.
- Correlation heatmap for identifying inter-feature correlations, which guides model decisions on
feature scaling and selection.
2. Data Preprocessing:
- Categorical Encoding:*Label encoding is applied to categorical columns (e.g., `job`, `marital`,
`education`) to convert them to numerical representations for model input. This method allows the
neural network to recognize patterns in discrete variables.
- Standard Scaling: Scaling of continuous variables (like `balance`, `duration`, and `campaign`)
is done using StandardScaler, which normalizes features to a standard Gaussian distribution. This
process ensures uniform feature influence on model training, preventing features with larger numeric
ranges from disproportionately affecting the model.
3. Model Selection - Neural Network:
- Model Rationale: A neural network is chosen due to its ability to model complex non-linear
relationships and manage large, high-dimensional datasets efficiently. This approach allows the
network to learn intricate patterns within the campaign data that simpler models may overlook.
- Architecture: The model is structured with three hidden layers:
- 64, 32, and 16 neurons in each layer, respectively, each followed by ReLU (Rectified Linear
Unit) activation.
- Sigmoid activation in the output layer to produce binary outputs, indicating subscription
likelihood.
- Optimizer and Loss Function: The Adam optimizer, known for its efficiency in handling large
data and sparse gradients, and binary cross-entropy loss function are utilized for binary
classification.
- Regularization - Early Stopping: Early stopping monitors validation loss, preventing overfitting
by halting training when performance on unseen data stops improving.
4. Model Training:
- Validation Split: A 20% validation split helps evaluate model generalizability and optimize
hyperparameters during training.
- Batch Size and Epochs: The model is trained with a batch size of 32 for computational
efficiency and 50 epochs with early stopping to reduce overfitting risks.
5. Performance Evaluation and Visualizations:
- ROC Curve: The ROC curve and AUC score are visualized to illustrate the model?s
performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity. A higher AUC score reflects a stronger ability to
distinguish between classes (subscribers vs. non-subscribers).
- Confusion Matrix: The confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of correct and
incorrect predictions, offering insights into specific areas of model improvement.
- Training History: Loss graphs for training and validation data showcase the model's learning
process, indicating convergence and any overfitting signs.
6. Test Data Prediction and Output:
- The model processes the test data, making predictions that are then saved in
`bank_test_predictions.csv`. This output assists in evaluating real-world predictive capability.
Expected Benefits and Model Improvements:
By leveraging a neural network with three hidden layers, the model can capture nuanced
relationships within the data that simpler classifiers may miss. This architecture, combined with
feature scaling and regularization, should improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting,
resulting in a model capable of making robust predictions on unseen customer data.
Overall, the neural network?s advanced capacity to model complex patterns and the detailed
preprocessing workflow should lead to highly accurate subscription predictions, providing actionable
insights for campaign strategies.
