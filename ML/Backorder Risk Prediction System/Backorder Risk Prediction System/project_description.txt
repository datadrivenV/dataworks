Project Description - Manufacturing Backorder Prediction

Overview:
This project involves predicting whether a product will go on backorder based on various inventory metrics. 
The analysis uses a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model for prediction, providing insights into feature importance and model performance.

Data Description:
The dataset includes various inventory-related features such as national inventory level, lead time, sales, and forecasts.
The target variable is 'went_on_backorder', which indicates whether the product actually went on backorder.

Data Cleaning:
- Missing values are filled using the median of each column.
- Categorical variables (if any) are converted to numerical codes.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Distribution plots for all numerical features to understand their spread and central tendency.
- A correlation matrix heatmap to explore potential multicollinearity between features.

Model Training:
- A LightGBM classifier is used due to its effectiveness in handling diverse data types and its efficiency in training.
- The model is trained using 80% of the data, with 20% held out for testing.

Model Evaluation:
- The model's performance is evaluated using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- A confusion matrix is presented to visualize the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

Feature Importance:
- A bar plot of feature importances is generated to highlight which features most significantly impact the model's predictions.

Conclusions:
- The GBM model provides a robust way to predict backorders, and the feature importance plot offers valuable insights into which inventory metrics are most influential in the prediction.
- The analysis could help in inventory management decisions and in mitigating risks associated with product shortages or excess stock.
